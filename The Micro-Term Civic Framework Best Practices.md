## 1. Best Practices

### 1.1 Best Practice: The Hands-Off Approach

**Summary:**
Resist the urge to add extra “safety rules” and micromanaging policies on top of the kernel—especially around money, precision, and doer behavior. The system’s reciprocity loops are designed to self-correct over time if you let them breathe.

#### 1.1.1 Why “Hands-Off” is a Best Practice

The kernel is built around reciprocal feedback loops:
	•	Askers define what they want.
	•	Doers, chosen randomly from non-askers, interpret and act within reasonable constraints.
	•	Everyone sees how well (or poorly) that interaction goes.
	•	Future asks and future willingness to do are shaped by those experiences.

Because of that, many problems that look like misuse or “failure” at first pass are actually:
	•	teaching askers to specify better or scope more realistically,
	•	revealing which doers are consistently helpful vs. consistently flaky,
	•	nudging the group toward norms about “what’s reasonable here” without hardcoding them.

Adding extra, top-down rules (e.g., “all leftover money must be returned,” “no unconventional solutions allowed,” “doers must always match this exact spec”) can:
	•	short-circuit that learning,
	•	reintroduce rigid bureaucracy,
	•	and weaken the very trust and creativity the method relies on.

**The Hands-Off Approach says:**

Let the kernel do its work to help the group adapt naturally before jumping to fixes that might have sorted themselves out without intervention.
Only add extra rules when you have clear, repeated evidence that the natural feedback loops aren’t enough.

⸻

#### 1.1.2 Example: Budget and “Misuse” of Funds

A very common temptation:

“We should set a rule that all leftover budget money must be returned to prevent doers from ‘stealing’ or splurging.”

**The framework’s stance:**
	•	If you give a doer $2 for pickle chips and you don’t specify anything else:
	•	you are asking for pickle chips, not for a precise transactional ledger;
	•	the doer’s job is to get you “pickle chips for the BBQ” in a reasonable way.

**Hands-off means:**
	•	Let the natural consequences of under- or over-budgeting fall mostly on the asker:
	•	If the amount was too low → the doer will either:
	•	partially complete the task, or
	•	decline next time, or
	•	signal back, “this budget doesn’t match reality.”
	•	If the amount was more than needed → the doer might:
	•	return the extra,
	•	roll it into a commonly accepted shared pot, or
	•	use a bit for themselves in a way the community finds acceptable (e.g., buying a soda/beer after saving the group money).

If people repeatedly hate the outcomes (“Why did we give $20 for ribs and they came back with cheap ribs plus a T-shirt?”), the fix is usually:
	•	improve the ask (“Return any unspent funds,” or “buy the best ribs you can up to $20”),
	•	or change who you invite as doers (socially, not via booting).

Not to smother the kernel in anti-misuse clauses.

⸻

#### 1.1.3 Example: Task Interpretation and “We Meant Something Else”

Consider the BBQ pickle case:
	•	Ask: “$2.00 for pickle chips for Saturday’s barbecue.”
	•	Doer’s possible good-faith outcomes include:
	•	Partial completion:
	•	“I bought one mason jar of pickles because prices are wild; it’s not a feast, but it’s something.”
	•	Counter-intuitive solution:
	•	Pocketing the $2 and going to McDonald’s to ask for 30 little cups of free burger pickles, delivering more pickle chips than expected via unconventional means.

**From a hands-off perspective:**
	•	Both can be valid within execution liberty, as long as:
	•	the doer genuinely tried to serve the ask,
	•	didn’t violate non-violence / non-coercion,
	•	and stayed inside or reasonably around the stated constraints.

If the group loves the ingenuity, they’ll learn:
	•	“We should leave room for clever solutions; that was great.”

If they hate it, they’ll learn:
	•	“Next time, we’ll specify: ‘Do not rely on free condiments; just buy a jar.’”

Either way, the feedback changes future asks and trust patterns—without needing the OS to outlaw creative execution.

⸻

#### 1.1.4 What the Hands-Off Approach Is Not

It is not:
	•	“Ignore abuse forever.”
	•	“Never clarify asks.”
	•	“Never talk about what people actually want.”

It is:
	•	“Let one or two cycles of reality and reciprocity play out before you reach for extra rules.”
	•	“Assume that vague asks, naive budgets, and weird doer choices are part of how people learn the system, not signs the system is broken.”

If, after repeated cycles, a specific pattern is repeatedly destructive and doesn’t respond to normal feedback, then it’s a candidate for a higher-order best practice or a local norm—not an automatic kernel change.

⸻

#### 1.1.5 Evolutionary Feedback, Not Central Planning

The Hands-Off Approach works because the kernel is wired to behave like an evolutionary system, not a centrally planned one.

Every interaction between askers, doers, and the surrounding group acts like a tiny evolutionary step:
	•	**Natural selection**
	•	Doer behaviors and solutions that:
	•	meet needs well enough,
	•	feel fair enough,
	•	and sit comfortably within the group’s cultural norms
	tend to be remembered, appreciated, and informally repeated.
	•	Behaviors and solutions that consistently:
	•	disappoint,
	•	feel exploitative, or
	•	clash with local norms
	tend to get ignored, avoided, or worked around.
Over time, the method quietly “selects” for the combinations of asks and responses that are fit enough for that particular group.
	•	**Iterative mutation**
	•	Asks change:
	•	people rewrite their requests after seeing what actually happens,
	•	they refine budgets, clarify constraints, or broaden them to allow more creativity.
	•	Doer strategies change:
	•	someone tries buying bulk pickles instead of individual jars,
	•	or discovers the “McDonald’s free pickles” hack,
	•	or learns that too clever feels off to the group and dials it back.
	•	Each cycle introduces small “mutations” in how problems are framed and solved.
The ones that work stick; the ones that don’t, fade.
	•	**Genetic drift (local flavor)**
	•	The “pickle chip meta” in Timbuktu might drift into:
	•	“just use whatever pickled veg we grow or can cheaply access,”
	•	while in Los Angeles, the same kernel might drift into:
	•	“somebody always brings that one fancy brand from Trader Joe’s.”
	•	This is not a bug; it’s a feature:
	•	the same kernel produces distinct local patterns that actually fit their environments.
	•	The framework doesn’t force uniformity; it lets communities evolve their own norms.

Because of this, non-interference is not negligence. It is:

A deliberate choice to let evolutionary feedback do its work:
	•	asks adapting to doers and the social environment,
	•	doers adapting to asks and the social environment,
	•	and the environment itself gradually revealing its own norms and boundaries.

Even when outcomes feel “off-kilter,” they’re still informative:
	•	The weird solution that barely passes:
	•	tells observers something about the doer (“they’re clever / cutting corners / over- or under-shooting”),
	•	tells observers something about the asker (“they scoped this well / poorly / naively”),
	•	and—crucially—tells everyone something about the group environment:
	•	what people will tolerate,
	•	what they quietly dislike,
	•	what they enthusiastically celebrate.

In that sense, the kernel is not just solving problems; it is continuously mapping the group’s unspoken norms:
	•	what counts as “reasonable”,
	•	how much creativity is welcomed,
	•	how much self-reward feels fair,
	•	where the invisible cultural lines actually are.

The Hands-Off Approach trusts that:
	•	if you let this evolutionary loop run,
	•	and refrain from overcorrecting at the first sign of discomfort,

the system will tend to:
	•	converge on locally sensible practices,
	•	surface genuinely novel solutions,
	•	and make the “real culture” of the group visible—so people can respond to that, not to an idealized rulebook fantasy.

Oh, this is a great next layer—this is basically:

“Okay, you built an evolutionary machine.
Now how do you learn to listen to what it’s telling you, instead of forcing it to match your map?”


⸻

### 1.2 Best Practice: Environmental Attunement & Learning to “Listen” to Natural Feedback Loops

**Summary:**
The Micro-Term Civic Framework kernel is designed to behave like a simple evolutionary system: asks, doer behaviors, and group responses all co-adapt over time. But that only becomes an actual engineering advantage when people learn to listen to what the environment is saying, rather than forcing it to match their prior theories. This best practice is about cultivating that listening.

⸻

#### 1.2.1 Expectations vs. Reality: The Map Is Not the Territory

Even people who pride themselves on “seeing the world as it is” are always operating with:
	•	personal histories,
	•	cultural baggage,
	•	unspoken intuitions,
	•	local norms and connotations.

Every shared word in a Micro-Term—
“pickle chips”, “cheap”, “fair”, “helpful”, “wasteful”—
is doing more work than its bare dictionary definition.
	•	Denotation: the simple, literal construct (e.g., “pickles sliced into chips”).
	•	Connotation: the layered meanings from each person’s lived experience, culture, memories.

We see this in obvious cases like clowns:
	•	For some: clowns are terrifying.
	•	For others: clowns are delightful nostalgia.

We can build partial psychological/sociological models (e.g., mask theory: the painted-on smile hides the true expression underneath), but:

No model can fully explain “clown logic” for all people in all places without knowing their actual lived context.

The same is true in Micro-Term interactions:
	•	The McDonald’s pickles hack might feel:
	•	ingenious and thrifty to some,
	•	slightly low-status or tacky to others,
	•	mechanically fine but morally off to yet others (“are we abusing the free condiment policy?”),
	•	or even harmful in the long run if it introduces externalities (e.g., McDonald’s changes its pricing or policy in response).

The best practice here is:

Treat your initial interpretation as a hypothesis, not a verdict.
Use the kernel’s feedback loops to see:
	•	how people actually react,
	•	what they’re willing to repeat,
	•	where they organically push back or quietly opt out.

Instead of saying:
	•	“The McDonald’s solution is obviously correct/incorrect,”

you watch:
	•	Does it get re-used?
	•	Do people complain or roll their eyes?
	•	Do askers start specifying “just buy jars at the store” next time?
	•	Do doers stop volunteering in situations where that kind of hack is expected?

The environment—through behavior over time—is your real dataset.

⸻

#### 1.2.2 The Engineering Method as Natural Selection

What you’re doing with the kernel is very close to the engineering method:
	1.	Define a goal (the ask).
	2.	Attempt a solution (the doer’s execution).
	3.	Compare result to goal.
	4.	Adjust the design, the ask, the method, or all three.

In nature, this is literally evolution via natural selection:
	•	Mutations (new behaviors, new ways of asking or doing) appear.
	•	Some are filtered out (they fail, or nobody wants to repeat them).
	•	Some persist (fit “well enough” in the local environment).
	•	Over many cycles, a lineage of successful patterns emerges.

In Micro-Term terms:
	•	Solutions that work well
	•	become informal templates:
	•	“That ribs arrangement worked great, let’s do it again.”
	•	“That way of running surveys was painless; let’s reuse it.”
	•	Solutions that never work
	•	naturally fall away:
	•	doers stop accepting similar tasks,
	•	askers stop framing requests that way.
	•	Solutions that work partially
	•	inform future decomposition:
	•	“We learned that part of this approach is good,
	the rest needs to be handled as separate, smaller tasks.”

This isn’t just “trial and error.” It’s continuous adaptation:
	•	Askers refine their requests as they see what doers can reasonably do.
	•	Doers refine their effort and creativity as they see what the group values and tolerates.
	•	The whole environment (the “culture” of the Micro-Term) shifts quietly as these patterns accumulate.

Beavers, humans, and other reality-testing creatures have been doing this forever:
	•	building dams, bridges, tools, processes,
	•	failing, adjusting, and passing on the successful bits.

The Micro-Term kernel is just a small, explicit harness for that same pattern.

⸻

#### 1.2.3 Practicing Environmental Attunement

To actually use this evolutionary structure well, groups have to practice attunement rather than control. Some concrete habits:
	1.	Watch behavior more than rhetoric.
	•	Don’t just listen to what people say they value; observe what they repeatedly do:
	•	Which asks keep showing up?
	•	Which solutions people quietly repeat?
	•	Which tasks always stall or get declined?
	2.	Look for patterns over multiple cycles, not single events.
	•	One weird McDonald’s pickles incident doesn’t need a policy.
	•	Five similar incidents and a creeping sense of resentment? That’s a signal that the environment is telling you something about norms and expectations.
	3.	Distinguish “this felt weird” from “this is systemically harmful.”
	•	It’s okay for solutions to feel off-kilter the first time; that might be where novelty lives.
	•	Attune to whether people:
	•	adapt and incorporate the idea, or
	•	reject it more firmly each time it reappears.
	4.	Treat local drift as a feature, not a bug.
	•	It’s okay if:
	•	Timbuktu’s version of “good enough” looks very different from Los Angeles’.
	•	As long as the kernel rules are respected:
	•	asks / doers remain non-violent and voluntary,
	•	asker≠doer, random invitation, and execution liberty hold,
	•	the flavor of solutions can be locally unique without breaking the framework.
	5.	Use discomfort as data, not panic.
	•	If a solution makes people uncomfortable:
	•	ask why,
	•	test small tweaks,
	•	observe whether those tweaks survive.
	•	Avoid jumping immediately to hard rules or bans; let the environment tell you whether a pattern is truly “unfit” or just not yet understood.

⸻

#### 1.2.4 Reading the Environment as a Mirror

When you approach problem-solving iteratively, something subtle but powerful happens:
	•	The patterns of what get accepted, tolerated, or rejected don’t just tell you about:
	•	this doer or this asker,
	•	they also tell you about:
	•	the group environment as a whole.

If people “get away with”:
	•	certain degrees of self-reward (the extra beer from leftover change),
	•	certain types of clever hacks,
	•	certain levels of vagueness in asks,

that reveals:
	•	where the unspoken boundaries really are,
	•	what the group currently considers “fair enough,”
	•	how the group balances thrift vs. dignity, creativity vs. predictability.

Environmental attunement means treating those emergent patterns as:

A mirror, not a moral failure.

You can then ask:
	•	Do we like what this mirror shows?
	•	If not, do we adjust our asks, our behavior, or our culture?
	•	Or do we change nothing, accepting that this is who we actually are here, for now?

The Micro-Term kernel doesn’t tell you what to value.
It simply provides a clean, non-coercive way for your values to show up through behavior over time.

Environmental attunement is the discipline of:
	•	not lying to yourself about what the environment is actually telling you,
	•	and learning from that, instead of trying to overwrite it from the top down.

⸻

### 2.1 Function: Surplus Handling Strategies (Doer Reward vs Communal Pot)

**Goal:**
Offer a couple of canonical ways to handle leftover budget / surplus without changing the kernel, so communities can pick what fits their environment.

The kernel says only:
	•	Askers define the goal and any constraints (including budget).
	•	Doers act in good faith within those constraints.
	•	Partial completion is valid.
	•	Doers have execution liberty.

It does not say what must happen to surplus. This function gives you two “dial settings.”

⸻

**2.1.1 SURPLUS = DOER (Primitive A)**

Default: If the ask does not say otherwise, any unspent budget is the doer’s to keep.

No extra rules. No “but only if…” caveats in the kernel.

Immediate effects:
	•	Doers know:
“If I can do this cheaper without being a jerk, I walk away with a little upside.”
	•	Askers know:
“If I’m sloppy with budget or don’t specify, I might be overpaying and they keep the remainder.”

What the environment does with that:
	•	In some groups, this becomes:
	•	a light, appreciated “thank you” for effort and ingenuity.
	•	In others, it may:
	•	trigger resentment (“they always keep too much”),
	•	push askers to get more precise or to explicitly override the default:
	•	“Return any extra to the shared pot,”
	•	or cause a fork:
	•	one Micro-Term keeps SURPLUS = DOER,
	•	another spins up with a different norm.

Over time, you can get:
	•	emergent “bonus culture” (people like rewarding doers and being doers as a result),
	•	or emergent “tight accounting culture” (people add constraints),
	•	or a mix, depending on what feels “fit enough” locally.

All of that from just:
“extra goes with the doer unless stated otherwise.”

⸻

**2.1.2 SURPLUS = POT (Primitive B)**

Default: If the ask does not say otherwise, any unspent budget goes into a communal pot for that Micro-Term.

Again, no conditions. No “half and half,” no enforcement machinery in the kernel. Just the default.

Immediate effects:
	•	Doers know:
“If I come in under budget, I don’t personally profit by default.”
	•	Askers know:
“I can be a bit loose with budget and the extra will still stay ‘in the family’.”

What the environment does with that:
	•	In some groups, this reinforces:
	•	stronger “we” feeling around shared resources,
	•	comfort with giving slightly generous budgets because surplus isn’t lost to the group.
	•	In others, it might:
	•	reduce individual incentive for clever cost-saving,
	•	inspire people to add their own appreciation layer:
	•	informal gifts,
	•	thank-you rounds,
	•	later decisions to pay bonuses from the pot because “we realized what we wanted all along was to make doers feel seen.”

And again, if it really doesn’t fit, you might see:
	•	a fork to a SURPLUS = DOER instance,
	•	or local overrides:
	•	“For this category of tasks, you keep what you save.”

All of that from:
“extra goes to the pot unless stated otherwise.”

⸻

**2.1.3 Why This Minimal Toggle Matters**

What you’re highlighting with this function is:
	•	One tiny, unqualified design choice—who owns surplus by default—can:
	•	change how people feel about doing tasks,
	•	change how people budget,
	•	reveal latent preferences about fairness, reward, and trust,
	•	nudge some groups toward forks, hybrid norms, or bonus patterns.

You don’t have to pre-bake any of that into the kernel.

You just:
	1.	Pick SURPLUS = DOER or SURPLUS = POT as your starting default.
	2.	Watch what happens:
	•	Do norms stabilize?
	•	Do people push back?
	•	Do bonus practices emerge?
	•	Do new Micro-Terms fork with different defaults?

The environment does the rest.

⸻

### 2.2 Function: Record-Keeping as an Imported Environment Policy

Think of record-keeping as another environmental toggle:

Are we leaving footprints?
If so, what kind, where, and for how long?

The kernel itself is neutral:
	•	You can write everything down.
	•	You can write almost nothing down.
	•	You can do something in between.

This function treats record-keeping as an imported policy, like:

`import RECORD_POLICY from "MicroTerm/Environment"`

and then shows how to shape it with tiny conditionals rather than global, one-size rules.

⸻

### 2.2 Best Practice: Records as a Test Case – Do You Even Need Them?

**Vibe:**
This isn’t “Everyone knows successful groups keep meeting minutes.”
It’s:

“Let’s use record-keeping as a way to feel how this OS works,
starting from no records at all and only adding complexity if you genuinely need it.”

#### 2.2.1 Step Zero: No Records Is a Valid Strategy

First question is not what to record.
It’s:

“Should we import a records module at all?”

Human beings have:
	•	coordinated hunts,
	•	raised children,
	•	run villages,
	•	survived disasters,

for tens of thousands of years with:
	•	no written language,
	•	no spreadsheets,
	•	no “Action Items.docx”.

So yes:

“No record-keeping module” is a perfectly valid starting point.

For some groups and contexts:
	•	everyone is close enough to remember who did what yesterday,
	•	tasks are small and low-stakes,
	•	and the natural “we just remember” channel is good enough.

In that environment:
	•	writing things down might add more friction than value,
	•	and might even make people less likely to participate
(because it suddenly feels official, tracked, bureaucratic).

So, meta-lesson #1:

Don’t make assumptions like “good groups have to have  minutes,” or "making this work will cost us in databases and technology"
Ask first: “What happens if we write nothing down and just see what we notice?”

Let the default be:

`import RECORDS = NONE`

…and then treat everything beyond that as an experiment, not a requirement.

⸻

#### 2.2.2 A Tiny First Import: One Simple Note

If you do decide you want some kind of record, try the smallest useful thing first.

**Example 1: Just a task log**

You might start with:

“We’re going to write one line per action in a notebook on the kitchen counter.”

Something like:
	•	“2025-11-15 – Pickles delivered for BBQ.”
	•	“2025-11-22 – Internet options gathered from 3 providers.”
	•	“2025-11-29 – Trash cleanup attempt – nobody accepted invite.”

No who, no details, no money.

This lets you:
	•	look back and see:
	•	“Oh, we have tried a cleanup three times; it’s not just a feeling,”
	•	“We actually do more than we think; we forget.”
	•	without creating:
	•	big privacy issues,
	•	dossiers on people,
	•	a feeling of surveillance.

From a Micro-Term perspective, that’s like:

```
import RECORDS
  LOG_SCOPE = LOCAL
  LOG_DEPTH = EVENT_ONLY
  RETENTION = “until the notebook fills up”
```

But you don’t even need those words.
You just need a notebook.

⸻

#### 2.2.3 Adding One More Layer: Who Did What (Sometimes)

If that goes well and you find yourself thinking:

“I wish I remembered who handled that really well,”
**or**
“We keep misunderstanding money; it’d help to know who was involved,”

you can add one more bit:

**Example 2: “What + Who” only for some actions**

Maybe you try:
	•	For money-related tasks:
	•	write the ask, the date, and the doer.
	•	For everything else:
	•	keep the simple one-line log.

The crux:

“If money changes hands, we note who asked and who did,
just so we can untangle confusion later. Otherwise we stay light.”

You have just:
	•	written your first conditional policy
	•	without needing to call it that.

The important thing is how it feels:
	•	Does this make people more comfortable or less?
	•	Do they ask for more tasks or fewer?
	•	Does it actually help resolve misunderstandings, or does it gather dust?

If it feels wrong, back it off.
If it feels helpful, keep it.

⸻

#### 2.2.4 Why We’re Doing This: Learning to Think in “Imports”

The point of this section isn’t:
	•	“Here is the correct logging standard.”

It’s to show you:

How to think of any extra structure
as an imported environmental policy, not a moral requirement.

Records are just a convenient test case.

You can feel, in a very concrete way, how this OS behaves when you:
	•	import nothing (RECORDS = NONE),
	•	import a tiny note system,
	•	import one modest conditional (“more detail only when money is involved”).

As you do that, you start to internalize a few key lessons:
	1.	You can get pretty far with nothing.
	•	Many small groups will be perfectly okay with “we just talk and remember.”
	2.	Small imports change the environment a lot.
	•	A single notebook can nudge people’s behavior.
	•	A single “we note who did money tasks” might change how carefully people act.
	3.	You don’t need big policy documents.
	•	You can say:
	•	“We only write things down for X type of task,”
	•	and that’s already a meaningful, engineered choice.
	4.	Every import is an experiment.
	•	Try it.
	•	See if people feel safer, freer, more effective—or more tense, watched, confused.
	•	Keep, tweak, or throw it out accordingly.

⸻

### 2.2 Best Practice: Surface Area & the “Human Computer” – Do You Even Need Records?

The previous sections have mostly said:

“Try no records first, then only add the smallest notes you actually need.”

This best practice is the next step:
use record-keeping as a way to understand surface area:
	•	Who needs to know what
	•	for how long
	•	for a task to be done well?

And: what changes when you shrink or expand that surface?

Before we talk about notebooks, apps, or ledgers, we start with a more radical question:

What if the “record system” lives only in people’s hands and heads?

To explore that, meet Jerry.

⸻

#### 2.2.1 Thought Experiment: “Jerry the Juicer” in a Human Computer

Imagine a very strange—but oddly effective—Micro-Term instance.

The people in it don’t see:
	•	a dashboard,
	•	a spreadsheet,
	•	or a master plan.

What they see is:
	•	one card,
	•	one pencil,
	•	and one person handing them an envelope or note at a time.

They are each a “cell” in a big human computer. The “memory” of the system isn’t a database; it’s:
	•	the instructions on their card,
	•	plus whatever little scribbles they’re allowed to make as they go.


⸻

Jerry the Juicer
We like to imagine man and machine are nothing alike, but did you know you can actually build a functional computer out of other people?
Let’s do a thought experiment about a “Micro-Term Instance” composed of nothing more than a record relay system. Each member can only see information contained by their own record and a record passed to them by the previous member in a long, human-information chain. Only a tiny bit of information is shared between anyone.
In the weird world of this Micro-Term, the “memory” and “storage” of the group’s dealings aren’t in filing cabinets, legal pads, notes apps, or even in most of the participant’s minds. Instead, the system “remembers” and offers feedback to the entire network through a set of instructions unique to each member’s the present task and their part to play as a “doer.”
Let’s imagine how this would work on the scale of a single person in that chain…
Meet “Jerry the Juicer.”
Jerry is in a strange Micro-Term instance. Strange, but... oddly effective at its stated goal. Or... at least he thinks so. In actual fact, there might be a lot more that Jerry doesn’t know about his Micro-Term than he does know.
While waiting at a stripmall bus stop on a cloudy autumn afternoon, Jerry met a man that would change his life: Terry the Trucker.
“Hey you!” shouted a disembodied male Brooklynite voice as Terry looked up from his phone and  turned his head, “Yeah! You!” Said a chubby man approaching quickly  in a red trucker cap and wrinkled carhartt with a stitched name tag: Terry.  “Can you follow these instructions?” he asked, as he handed Jerry a plain, business-sized envelope.Terry turned the envelope over slowly and found… another blank side.
“I’m sorry, what’s this? What instructions?” Jerry asked the strange man.
Terry replied, “I don’t know, and I don’t really care. All I know is I get a palate of oranges and some gas money on Mondays and I bring 'em to that door over there in the alley.” He said, pointing. Jerry turned his head to see a single steel door in the dark alleyway.
“I’m sorry, what are you talking about?” Insisted Jerry. Slightly impatient now, Jerry began to slow his speech,
“CAN YOU FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS?” Uttered Terry in a patronizing tone.“I don’t even know what it is…” Jerry paused for an explanation… A pair of rolling eyes and a blank stare. “You don’t know anything else?” Jerry probed, “What’s behind that door?” Jerry asked again.
“Look man, I don’t know and I can only stand here for thirty-five more seconds before I have to jot you down as a ‘no’. So get reading!” Terry retorted, glancing at a laminated notecard and then at his watch. His foot began to tap.
Jerry opened the envelope and pulled out a laminated notecard just like the one between Terry’s fingers… He read silently to himself. “Wow! They’ll pay me that much to…”
“Ah ah ah!” Terry interrupted. “I don’t care to know the details and, if you actually read it to the end, you’d know it’s an efficiency thing they’re trying out; And I’m all about efficiency…”
Jerry’s eyes darted to the bottom of the card, “Oh yeah....  it says so right there. Huh…” puzzled Jerry as his eyes quickly scanned the rest of the card again, his bewilderment fading into a smirk..
“So what’ll it be?” Terry might as well have been speaking to a deaf five year old: “CAAAN…. YOUUUU… FOLLLLLOOOWWWW… THOSEEEE….. INSTRUUUUUUUUUCTIONNNNNNNSSSS?” Terry jabbed. Tap..tap.tap.tap went Terry’s work boots with impatience as they wrapped against the sidewalk.
“Uhhhh…. Yeah!” Said Jerry, his smirk now betraying a sly, knowing confidence, “Just bring the palate to the door. I’ll handle the rest!” This was an enthusasm Jerry hadn’t felt in,,, quite a while… Terry whipped out a yellow school pencil from his pocket and ticked a single mark on his notecard in received yet banal bureaucratically. 
“Just in time... “ Terry sighed deeply in relief and began to turn away in stride.,, As Terry’s foot landed on the concrete. He paused for a moment, performed a small face-palm and rotated himself back to Jeffy
 “Oh yeah!” his hand stretched outward, “here’s your first pencil!" He said; his mocking tone now just barely perceptable. His sarcasm, however, felt telegraphed : “it’s got an eraser for a reason!” Terry turned back the way he came toward a red semi truck parked just a few spots down. As Terry walked away to unload the promised palate of oranges, Jerry stood up and walked down the alley to the dark door. Deet… Doot.. Daat.Dat. an electrical security lock responded to the 4-digit pin Jerry had already memorized... A green light… a released latch… Jerry pushed the door open: a stark white room. A centered counter island and… the industrial juicer.
Jerry giggled to himself in confidence, “And to think…” Jerry said under his breath, “some idiot is going to pay me $1000 every Monday to just…” He looked around the room once more and then to his laminated card to make sure he hadn’t missed something… Nope: “to just juice a palate of oranges…” 



That’s it. That’s Jerry’s entire visible world:
	•	task: “juice these oranges on Mondays,”
	•	tool: juicer,
	•	pay: good,
	•	knowledge of the system: almost zero.

He doesn’t know:
	•	who drinks the juice,
	•	who else is in the chain,
	•	what Terry’s card says beyond “I drive oranges to that door.”

He’s a single node in a very narrow, very efficient, very compartmentalized human computer.

#### 2.2.2 What Jerry’s World Teaches Us About Surface Area

Jerry’s situation is extreme, but it reveals something crucial:

You can absolutely “run” a Micro-Term-like pipeline
with zero global records and minimal local knowledge.

The only “records” here are:
	•	Terry’s small notecard (who he offered the job to, maybe how many times),
	•	Jerry’s laminated instructions,
	•	the memory of a keypad code.

From a surface area perspective:
	•	Very few people know very few facts:
	•	Terry knows “oranges + door + I get gas money.”
	•	Jerry knows “door code + juicer + I get $1000.”
	•	Almost nobody knows:
	•	who designed this system,
	•	what happens to the juice,
	•	whether this is a charity, a scam, a corporate supply chain, or something darker.

That has real pros and cons:

**Pros (for efficiency & safety):**
	•	Low drag:
	•	Nobody is sitting in long meetings trying to understand the entire pipeline.
	•	Each person just does their part.
	•	Low exposure:
	•	If someone wants to exploit the system, they can’t easily “see” all the pieces.
	•	If someone wants to harm Jerry, knowing he “juices oranges on Mondays” may not tell them much about anything else.

**Cons (for ethics & agency):**
	•	Low transparency:
	•	Jerry can’t audit what he’s a part of.
	•	He could be participating in something awesome… or something exploitative. He has almost no way to tell from inside his tiny box.
	•	High dependence on trust in the unseen:
	•	Jerry is trusting whoever designed this pipeline, sight unseen.
	•	If they’re well-meaning, great. If they’re not, he’ll be the last to know.

This is exactly what we mean by surface area:

Surface area = how many humans know how many facts for how long.

You can shrink surface area down to something like “Jerry’s laminated card,”
or expand it into a shared database everyone can query.

Either way:
	•	Well-meaning people can use it to coordinate better.
	•	Exploitative people can use it to push or hide harm.

That’s why record hygiene and data minimization matter, even in “boring” details.

#### 2.2.3 Bringing It Back to Micro-Term: Records as a Design Choice

The Jerry story is not “the right way” to run a Micro-Term. It’s a thought experiment:
	•	A zero-global-memory, ultra-narrow record system.
	•	A pure “human computer” where each person knows only:
	•	their own card,
	•	and whatever came in the envelope.

From there, you can ask:

“If my Micro-Term behaved like this, what would I gain?
What would I lose?
What would I need to add back?”

Some groups might say:
	•	“For our context (e.g., sensitive safety tasks, risky environments), we like very low surface area. We’ll deliberately adopt narrow, Jerry-like cards for some kinds of tasks.”

Others might say:
	•	“For our context (e.g., neighborhood projects, co-ops), that feels way too opaque. We need more shared knowledge and fewer sealed envelopes.”

The key lesson:

Record-keeping is not morally neutral plumbing.
It defines who can understand, question, and reshape the system.

So at this fundamental level, when you think about “importing records,” the first question isn’t:
	•	“What format should our notes be in?”

It’s:
	•	“How much do we want to be like Jerry’s world?”

⸻

#### 2.2.4 The First Real Record Import: Minimal, Punchy, and Conscious of Exposure

If we now define a first record import that is operationally “punchy” but conscious of surface area, it might look like:

“We only write down what the next doer needs to know for this action, and nothing more.”

In practice:
	•	The “record” is:
	•	a simple task description,
	•	maybe a budget amount,
	•	maybe a date,
	•	maybe a location.
	•	It is:
	•	passed to the next doer,
	•	updated or checked off,
	•	and then either:
	•	archived lightly, or
	•	thrown away once the group no longer needs it.

You might not log:
	•	everyone who saw it,
	•	all the side conversations,
	•	the internal politics,
	•	long-term history of who always needs help.

That keeps:
	•	surface area small (less to abuse, easier to forget),
	•	drag low (nobody is drowning in documentation),
	•	but still gives:
	•	enough memory to chain tasks together,
	•	enough structure for people at their step to know what to do.

And because this is Micro-Term:
	•	if, later, you find:
	•	confusion keeps happening,
	•	or patterns of misuse keep repeating,

you can then say:

“Okay, now we import a slightly larger record layer
—but we do it knowing exactly why and what surface area we’re adding.”

⸻

#### 2.2.5 Data Hygiene as “Who Needs to Know What, When?”

The data hygiene/safety takeaway at this level is simple:
	•	Every extra fact you store, for every extra person who can see it, for every extra day it exists, increases:
	•	the potential upside (more group wisdom, more learning),
	•	and the potential downside (more to exploit, leak, or weaponize).

So:
	•	Start by seeing if Jerry-level minimalism works in your context.
	•	If it doesn’t, add just enough record-keeping to solve the actual problem you observed.
	•	Always ask:
	•	“Who really needs to know this?”
	•	“For how long?”
	•	“What are we buying with this extra surface area—and what are we risking?”

Records aren’t inherently good or bad.
They’re just levers that change what your environment can remember, coordinate, and harm.

The OS doesn’t tell you where to set them.
It just encourages you to set them on purpose, not out of habit—
and Jerry is your reminder of just how far you can go with almost nothing, for better and for worse.
